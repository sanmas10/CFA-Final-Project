1. You have your choice of logos. I updated the megaphone one, plus added a new one.
2. I put an alegri picture at the bottom. I think it's hilarious, but of course, you do not need to use it, at all. 
3. Please put images in an images folder
4. Images must be optimized to reduce their file size. Use an online image optimizer.
5. The name of the site or a logo containing the name should go on every page.
6. Use alt attributes for images
